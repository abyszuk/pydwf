Issues with the libdwf code and documentation:

(1) Issues with the C header file 'dwf.h', as delivered with the SDK:

- In dwf.h, function FDwfDigitalInInputOrderSet, parameter 'fDioFirst' is a bool.
  This type doesn't exist in C, unless 'stdbool.h' is included.
- There's a bunch of lines in dwf.h with trailing spaces.
- The comment on the line describing the "dwfercUnknownError" constant is incorrect.
- In the definition of the DwfAnalogImpedance type constants, Admittance, Conductance, and Susceptance
  are commented as having unit 'Siemen', which should be "Siemens".
- typo: DwfAnalogImpedanceSeriesCapactance --> DwfAnalogImpedanceSeriesCapacitance
- The function 'FDwfAnalogInTriggerHoldOffInfo' has a parameter that is called 'pnStep' rather than 'pnSteps',
  as is used everywhere else:

    DWFAPI int FDwfAnalogInTriggerHoldOffInfo(HDWF hdwf, double *psecMin, double *psecMax, double *pnStep).

(2) Issues with the documentation, dwfsdk.pdf:

It's pretty incomplete; many details on how the instruments work are omitted.

Here are some concrete, easy-to-fix issues:

- Section 1.2 "the standard c-type bool". "bool" is not a standard C type, Bool_t is.
- Section 2 "FDwfGetLastError: bad description of "dwfercUnknownError".
- Section 2 "FDwfParamSet": not all DwfParam values found in the header file are described here.
- Section 4: not documented: FDwfDeviceEnableSet, FDwfDeviceParamGet, FDwfDeviceParamSet.
- Section 4: TRIGSRC values High and Low are not documented.

FDwfAnalogIOChannelNodeSetInfo:

Remark:

    The (Maximum - Minimum) / Steps is the step size.

    Probably not true?
