pydwf-examples-development
==========================

This directory contains Python scripts that are not quite ready to be distributed
as part of the pydwf package.

We still need examples in the following areas:

- AnalogIn: demos for different acquisition modes.

- AnalogOut: demos for different types of waves.

- Triggering.

- Dwf Parameters.

- DigitalIn measurements.

- DigitalOut control.

- AnalogImpedance measurements.
