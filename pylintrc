# Reasons to disable:
#
#    invalid-name             : Many warnings; mostly because of clashing PEP-8 and DWF style.
#    duplicate-code           : Too many spurious messages due to similar sub-APIs for different instruments.
#    too-many-arguments       : Purely stylistic; I think human judgement trumps a fixed threshold.
#    consider-using-f-string  : Not a big fan of f-string formatting.
